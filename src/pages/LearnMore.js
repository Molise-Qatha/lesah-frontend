            <p className="mission-text">
              LeSAH was born from firsthand experience. As a student at the National University of Lesotho, 
              I faced the same challenges you do—finding affordable accommodation near campus, 
              stretching a monthly stipend until it runs out, and moving heavy belongings when semesters end.
            </p>
            <p className="mission-text">
              These aren't just inconveniences; they're daily obstacles that affect your ability to focus on 
              what really matters: your education. LeSAH exists to remove those obstacles so you can thrive.
